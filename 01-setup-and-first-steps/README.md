## Getting Comfortable: Your First Prompts

Before diving into the impressive demos, let's start with some simple prompts you can try right now. **No code repository needed**! Just open a terminal and start Copilot CLI:

```bash
copilot
```

Try these beginner-friendly prompts:

```
> Explain what a dataclass is in Python in simple terms

> Write a function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key

> What's the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?

> Give me 5 best practices for writing clean Python code
```

Don't use Python? No problem! Just ask questions about your language of choice.

Notice how natural it feels. Just ask questions like you would to a colleague. When you're done exploring, type `/exit` to leave the session.

**The key insight**: GitHub Copilot CLI is conversational. You don't need special syntax to get started. Just ask questions in plain English.

## See It In Action

Now let's see why developers are calling this "having a senior engineer on speed dial."

> 📖 **Reading the Examples**: Lines starting with `>` are prompts you type inside an interactive Copilot CLI session. Lines without a `>` prefix are shell commands you run in your terminal.

> 💡 **About Example Outputs**: The sample outputs shown throughout this course are illustrative. Because Copilot CLI's responses vary each time, your results will differ in wording, formatting, and detail. Focus on the *type* of information returned, not the exact text.

### Demo 1: Code Review in Seconds

The course includes sample files with intentional code quality issues. If you're working on your local machine and haven't already cloned the repo, please run the `git clone` command below, navigate to the `copilot-cli-for-beginners` folder, and then run the `copilot` command.

```bash
# Clone the course repository if you're working locally and haven't already
git clone https://github.com/github/copilot-cli-for-beginners
cd copilot-cli-for-beginners

# Start Copilot
copilot
```

Once inside the interactive Copilot CLI session, run the following:

```
> Review @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py for code quality issues and suggest improvements
```

> 💡 **What's the `@` symbol used for?** The `@` symbol tells Copilot CLI to read a file. You'll learn all about this in Chapter 02. For now, just copy the command exactly as shown.

---

**The takeaway**: A professional code review in seconds. Manual review would take...well...more time than that!

---

### Demo 2: Explain Confusing Code

Ever stared at code wondering what it does? Try this in your Copilot CLI session:

```
> Explain what @samples/book-app-project/books.py does in simple terms
```

---

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Explain Code Demo](images/explain-code-demo.gif)

*Demo output varies. Your model, tools, and responses will differ from what's shown here.*

</details>

---

**What happens**: (your output will differ) Copilot CLI reads the file, understands the code, and explains it in plain English.

```
This is a book collection management module using Python dataclasses.

Think of it like a digital bookshelf:
- Book is a dataclass - a simple way to store book information (title, author, year, read status)
- BookCollection manages the entire collection and handles saving/loading

Key components:

1. @dataclass decorator (line 8)
   - Automatically creates __init__, __repr__, etc.
   - Clean way to define data structures in Python

2. BookCollection class (line 16)
   - Maintains a list of Book objects
   - Handles persistence with JSON file I/O
   - load_books() reads from data.json
   - save_books() writes to data.json using asdict()

3. Book operations:
   - add_book() - creates and saves new books
   - find_book_by_title() - searches collection
   - mark_as_read() - updates read status
   - find_by_author() - filters by author name

Common pattern: Read from JSON → Work with Python objects → Write back to JSON
```

**The takeaway**: Complex code explained like a patient mentor would explain it.

---

### Demo 3: Generate Working Code

Need a function you'd otherwise spend 15 minutes googling? Still in your session:

```
> Write a Python function that takes a list of books and returns statistics: 
  total count, number read, number unread, oldest and newest book
```

---

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Generate Code Demo](images/generate-code-demo.gif)

*Demo output varies. Your model, tools, and responses will differ from what's shown here.*

</details>

---

**What happens**: A complete, working function in seconds that you can copy-paste-run.

When you're done exploring, exit the session:

```
> /exit
```

**The takeaway**: Instant gratification, and you stayed in one continuous session the whole time.

# Modes and Commands

<img src="images/modes-and-commands.png" alt="Futuristic control panel with glowing screens, dials, and equalizers representing Copilot CLI modes and commands" width="800"/>

You've just seen what Copilot CLI can do. Now let's understand *how* to use these capabilities effectively. The key is knowing which of the three interaction modes to use for different situations.

> 💡 **Note**: Copilot CLI also has an **Autopilot** mode where it works through tasks without waiting for your input. It's powerful but requires granting full permissions and uses premium requests autonomously. This course focuses on the three modes below. We'll point you to Autopilot once you're comfortable with the basics.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Analogy: Dining Out

Think of using GitHub Copilot CLI like going out to eat. From planning the trip to placing your order, different situations call for different approaches:

| Mode | Dining Analogy | When to Use |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Plan** | GPS route to the restaurant | Complex tasks - map out the route, review stops, agree on the plan, then drive |
| **Interactive** | Talking to the waiter | Exploration and iteration - ask questions, customize, get real-time feedback |
| **Programmatic** | Drive-through ordering | Quick, specific tasks - stay in your environment, get a result fast |

Just like dining out, you'll naturally learn when each approach feels right.

<img src="images/ordering-food-analogy.png" alt="Three Ways to Use GitHub Copilot CLI - Plan Mode (GPS route to restaurant), Interactive Mode (talking to waiter), Programmatic Mode (drive-through)" width="800"/>

*Choose your mode based on the task: Plan for mapping it out first, Interactive for back-and-forth collaboration, Programmatic for quick one-shot results*

### Which Mode Should I Start With?

**Start with Interactive mode.** 
- You can experiment and ask follow-up questions
- Context builds naturally through conversation
- Mistakes are easy to correct with `/clear`

Once you're comfortable, try:
- **Programmatic mode** (`copilot -p "<your prompt>"`) for quick, one-off questions
- **Plan mode** (`/plan`) when you need to plan things out in more detail before coding

---

## The Three Modes

### Mode 1: Interactive Mode (start here)

<img src="images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode - Like talking to a waiter who can answer questions and adjust the order" width="250"/>

**Best for**: Exploration, iteration, multi-turn conversations. Like talking to a waiter who can answer questions, take feedback, and adjust the order on the fly.

Start an interactive session:

```bash
copilot
```

As you've seen up to this point, you'll see a prompt where you can type naturally. To get help on available commands, just type:

```
> /help
```

**Key insight**: Interactive mode maintains context. Each message builds on previous ones, just like a real conversation.

#### Interactive Mode Example

```bash
copilot

> Review @samples/book-app-project/utils.py and suggest improvements

> Add type hints to all functions

> Make the error handling more robust

> /exit
```

Notice how each prompt builds on the previous answer. You're having a conversation, not starting over each time.

---

### Mode 2: Plan Mode

<img src="images/plan-mode.png" alt="Plan Mode - Like planning a route before a trip using GPS" width="250"/>

**Best for**: Complex tasks where you want to review the approach before execution. Similar to planning a route before a trip using GPS.

Plan mode helps you create a step-by-step plan before writing any code. Use the `/plan` command or press **Shift+Tab** to cycle into Plan Mode:

> 💡 **Tip**: **Shift+Tab** cycles between modes: Interactive → Plan → Autopilot. Press it anytime during an interactive session to switch modes without typing a command.

```bash
copilot

> /plan Add a "mark as read" command to the book app
```

**Plan mode output:** (your output may differ)

```
📋 Implementation Plan

Step 1: Update the command handler in book_app.py
  - Add new elif branch for "mark" command
  - Create handle_mark_as_read() function

Step 2: Implement the handler function
  - Prompt user for book title
  - Call collection.mark_as_read(title)
  - Display success/failure message

Step 3: Update help text
  - Add "mark" to available commands list
  - Document the command usage

Step 4: Test the flow
  - Add a book
  - Mark it as read
  - Verify status changes in list output

Proceed with implementation? [Y/n]
```

**Key insight**: Plan mode lets you review and modify the approach before any code is written. Once a plan is complete, you can even tell Copilot CLI to save it to a file for later reference. For example, "Save this plan to `mark_as_read_plan.md`" would create a markdown file with the plan details.

> 💡 **Want something more complex?** Try: `/plan Add search and filter capabilities to the book app`. Plan mode scales from simple features to full applications.

> 📚 **Autopilot mode**: You may have noticed Shift+Tab cycles through a third mode called **Autopilot**. In autopilot mode, Copilot works through an entire plan without waiting for your input after each step — like handing a task to a colleague and saying "let me know when you're finished." The typical workflow is plan → accept → autopilot, which means you need to be good at writing plans first. Get comfortable with Interactive and Plan modes, then see the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/autopilot) when you're ready.

---

### Mode 3: Programmatic Mode

<img src="images/programmatic-mode.png" alt="Programmatic Mode - Like using a drive-through for a quick order" width="250"/>

**Best for**: Automation, scripts, CI/CD, single-shot commands. Like using a drive-through for a quick order without needing to talk to a waiter.

Use the `-p` flag for one-time commands that don't need interaction:

```bash
# Generate code
copilot -p "Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd"

# Get quick help
copilot -p "How do I read a JSON file in Python?"
```

**Key insight**: Programmatic mode gives you a quick answer and exits. No conversation, just input → output.

<details>
<summary>📚 <strong>Going Further: Using Programmatic Mode in Scripts</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

Once you're comfortable, you can use `-p` in shell scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate commit messages automatically
COMMIT_MSG=$(copilot -p "Generate a commit message for: $(git diff --staged)")
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"

# Review a file
copilot --allow-all -p "Review @myfile.py for issues"
```
> ⚠️ **About `--allow-all`**: This flag skips all permission prompts, letting Copilot CLI read files, run commands, and access URLs without asking first. This is necessary for programmatic mode (`-p`) since there's no interactive session to approve actions. Only use `--allow-all` with prompts you've written yourself and in directories you trust. Never use it with untrusted input or in sensitive directories.

</details>

Run shell commands directly without AI by prefixing with `!`:

```bash
copilot

> !git status
# Runs git status directly, bypassing the AI

> !python -m pytest tests/
# Runs pytest directly
```

### Switching Models

Copilot CLI supports multiple AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. The models available to you depend on your subscription level and region. Use `/model` to see your options and switch between them:

```bash
copilot
> /model

# Shows available models and lets you pick one. Select Sonnet 4.5.
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Some models cost more "premium requests" than others. Models marked **1x** (like Claude Sonnet 4.5) are a great default. They're capable and efficient. Higher-multiplier models use your premium request quota faster, so save those for when you really need them.

Time to put what you've learned into action.

---

## ▶️ Try It Yourself

### Interactive Exploration

Start Copilot and use follow-up prompts to iteratively improve the book app:

```bash
copilot

> Review @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py - what could be improved?

> Refactor the if/elif chain into a more maintainable structure

> Add type hints to all the handler functions

> /exit
```

### Plan a Feature

Use `/plan` to have Copilot CLI map out an implementation before writing any code:

```bash
copilot

> /plan Add a search feature to the book app that can find books by title or author

# Review the plan
# Approve or modify
# Watch it implement step by step
```

### Automate with Programmatic Mode

The `-p` flag lets you run Copilot CLI directly from your terminal without entering interactive mode. Copy and paste the following script into your terminal (not inside Copilot) from the repository root to review all Python files in the book app.

```bash
# Review all Python files in the book app
for file in samples/book-app-project/*.py; do
  echo "Reviewing $file..."
  copilot --allow-all -p "Quick code quality review of @$file - critical issues only"
done
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
# Review all Python files in the book app
Get-ChildItem samples/book-app-project/*.py | ForEach-Object {
  $relativePath = "samples/book-app-project/$($_.Name)";
  Write-Host "Reviewing $relativePath...";
  copilot --allow-all -p "Quick code quality review of @$relativePath - critical issues only" 
}
```

---

After completing the demos, try these variations:

1. **Interactive Challenge**: Start `copilot` and explore the book app. Ask about `@samples/book-app-project/books.py` and request improvements 3 times in a row.

2. **Plan Mode Challenge**: Run `/plan Add rating and review features to the book app`. Read the plan carefully. Does it make sense?

3. **Programmatic Challenge**: Run `copilot --allow-all -p "List all functions in @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py and describe what each does"`. Did it work on the first try?

---

## 📝 Assignment

### Main Challenge: Improve the Book App Utilities

The hands-on examples focused on reviewing and refactoring `book_app.py`. Now practice the same skills on a different file, `utils.py`:

1. Start an interactive session: `copilot`
2. Ask Copilot CLI to summarize the file: `@samples/book-app-project/utils.py What does each function in this file do?`
3. Ask it to add input validation: "Add validation to `get_user_choice()` so it handles empty input and non-numeric entries"
4. Ask it to improve error handling: "What happens if `get_book_details()` receives an empty string for the title? Add guards for that."
5. Ask for a docstring: "Add a comprehensive docstring to `get_book_details()` with parameter descriptions and return values"
6. Observe how context carries between prompts. Each improvement builds on the last
7. Exit with `/exit`

**Success criteria**: You should have an improved `utils.py` with input validation, error handling, and a docstring, all built through a multi-turn conversation.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

**Sample prompts to try:**
```bash
> @samples/book-app-project/utils.py What does each function in this file do?
> Add validation to get_user_choice() so it handles empty input and non-numeric entries
> What happens if get_book_details() receives an empty string for the title? Add guards for that.
> Add a comprehensive docstring to get_book_details() with parameter descriptions and return values
```

**Common issues:**
- If Copilot CLI asks clarifying questions, just answer them naturally
- The context carries forward, so each prompt builds on the previous
- Use `/clear` if you want to start over

</details>

### Bonus Challenge: Compare the Modes

The examples used `/plan` for a search feature and `-p` for batch reviews. Now try all three modes on a single new task: adding a `list_by_year()` method to the `BookCollection` class:

1. **Interactive**: `copilot` → ask it to design and build the method step by step
2. **Plan**: `/plan Add a list_by_year(start, end) method to BookCollection that filters books by publication year range`
3. **Programmatic**: `copilot --allow-all -p "@samples/book-app-project/books.py Add a list_by_year(start, end) method that returns books published between start and end year inclusive"`

**Reflection**: Which mode felt most natural? When would you use each?

<details>
<summary>🔧 <strong>Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Typing `exit` instead of `/exit` | Copilot CLI treats "exit" as a prompt, not a command | Slash commands always start with `/` |
| Using `-p` for multi-turn conversations | Each `-p` call is isolated with no memory of previous calls | Use interactive mode (`copilot`) for conversations that build on context |
| Forgetting quotes around prompts with `$` or `!` | Shell interprets special characters before Copilot CLI sees them | Wrap prompts in quotes: `copilot -p "What does $HOME mean?"` |

### Troubleshooting

**"Model not available"** - Your subscription may not include all models. Use `/model` to see what's available.

**"Context too long"** - Your conversation has used the full context window. Use `/clear` to reset, or start a new session.

**"Rate limit exceeded"** - Wait a few minutes and try again. Consider using programmatic mode for batch operations with delays.

</details>

# Summary

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Interactive mode** is for exploration and iteration - context carries forward. It's like having a conversation with someone who remembers what you've said up to that point.
2. **Plan mode** is normally for more involved tasks. Review before implementation.
3. **Programmatic mode** is for automation. No interaction needed.
4. **Essential commands** (`/help`, `/clear`, `/plan`, `/research`, `/model`, `/exit`) cover most daily use.

> 📋 **Quick Reference**: See the [GitHub Copilot CLI command reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/cli-command-reference) for a complete list of commands and shortcuts.
